# stock_picker
Solution for my Stock Picker project. What I learned is that I need to lookup at other Ruby methods to achieve the same result. In my solution, I essentially only used map and select, making it more complex than it should be. A matrix in which each row is subracting the values corresponding to the index (i.e. in row 2 every value in the column is subracted by the value in the array[1]). Afterwards, only the values after the diagonal are selected. Since the stock must first be bought, having a value before the diagonal would allow for the selling date to be before the buying date. The in arr_of_max, a new array is created with the max values of each array in the matrix. Lastly, the max_value is calculated (12), which is the greatest value of all subtractions. This value is then used to find the index in the matrices, resulting in [1,4] as desired. 
Methods to learn: combination, to_a, max_by.
